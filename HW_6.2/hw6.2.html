<h1>Homework 6.2: Census data ratios and categories </h1>
<h2>Jane Antonas</h2>
<h3>Each map utilizes a ratio of "New York civilians over the age of 16 years employed in construction occupations" to "total number of New York civilians over the age of 16 years that are employed." By comparing construction employees to total employees, the data is normalized for smaller or larger populations. Larger populations are probably going to have a larger raw count of construction employees. Using a ratio instead of a raw count makes the proportion of construction employees to all employees more clear. Each map uses data from the US Census Bureau.</h3>
<h3>Data used for this project:</h3>
    <a href="https://data.census.gov/table?t=Class+of+Worker:Employment:Employment+and+Labor+Force+Status&g=0400000US36$0500000&tid=ACSST1Y2021.S2407">View Data from the US Census Bureau</a>

<h2>Map 1<h2>
<h3>This map uses an equal count categorization mode, so each category contains the same number of counties. This map would be best for highlighting the median ratio of construction employees to total employment. By just looking at the middle range in the legend, you can see the median. This mode is not as efficient as the other modes at identifying "clusters" of data since all classes are presented equally.</h3>

<h2>Map 2:</h2>
<h3>This map uses an equal interval categorization mode, so each range in the legend increases by the same amount. This makes it easy to see the "extreme" counties, with the highest and lowest ratios. However, much of the data falls into the same range so the map appears mostly the same color, which may be misleading. Also, there seems to be one category that is not even represented on the map since no county falls into that range (0.135-0.173).</h3>

<h2>Map 3</h2>
<h3>This map uses a pretty breaks categorization mode. This mode is helpful in making the legend more easy to interpet with shorter, "prettier" decimals. Similar to the equal interval mode, it is easier to see the extremes in the data. However, the middle range of data gets "lumped in" to the same range and some categories are not even represented on the map, such as (0.15-0.2). On the flip side, this makes it easy to see clusters as well. This mode is helpful if any pattern in the raw data is unclear, as the map will help clarify any trends. </h3>
