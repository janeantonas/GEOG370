    <h3>Using data from the US Energy Information Administration, the amount of petroleum energy-related carbon emissions is displayed by state (in million metric tons). I am interested in the various economic and political factors that contribute to carbon dioxide emissions across the US. In the future, I'd like to cross-reference this data with a map of: 1) number of oil-burning power plants in each state, 2) states that have adopted California's Clean Cars Standards. This choropleth is a good starting point for analyzing how population, policy, and other factors contribute to emissions.</h3>
